# Summary

## Distribution of risk measures

- We calculate the quantiles, expectiles and extremiles from the standard residuals:

  - First, we compute the risk measures via QMLE at $\tau =\{1\%,5\%,10\%\}$.
  
  - Second, we compute the risk measures via MLE at $\tau =\{1\%,5\%,10\%\}$.
  
  - Third, we compute the risk measures via bootstrap at $\tau =\{1\%,5\%,10\%\}$.

- In the case of MLE, we estimate the GARCH model with t-Student innovations.

- In the case of bootstrap, we follow @pascual2006bootstrap.
